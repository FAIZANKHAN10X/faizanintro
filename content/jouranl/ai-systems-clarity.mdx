## The Problem

Most automation systems fail not because of tooling — but because of poor architectural clarity.

## Complexity vs Control

The more tools you stack without a structured logic map, the more fragile your infrastructure becomes.

## What Actually Scales

- Clear data contracts
- Deterministic workflows
- Versioned automation logic
- Observable event flows

Systems win when humans can still understand them.
